Greetings. This app is basically a Notepad clone written for the purpose 
of learning more about using Python and C++ together using pybind11. The 
app will be able to do a multitude of things like saving and opening 
files. 

The frontend is typically handled by Python by using the tkinter library,
while the backend code will be written in C++. The frontend the get the
backend code though a compiled python file that's generated using pybind11
itself.
